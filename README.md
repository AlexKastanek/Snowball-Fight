# Snowball Fight
Snowball Fight is a single player VR where the player throws snowballs. The player can practice with targets or challenge the snowman horde in a never-ending survival game mode.

It was developed by [Alex Kastanek](https://github.com/AlexKastanek) and [Bryce Monaco](https://github.com/BryceDMonaco) as the final project for CS 491 (Topics: Virtual Reality) in spring 2018.

In the survival gamemode, evil snowmen creep in from the fog towards the player.

In the survival gamemode, snowmen get close to the player and start damaging them. Hitting a snowman with a snowball makes that section of their body explode into purple smoke.

In the survival gamemode, a snowball is just about to hit a snowman in the head. Hitting a snowman in the head immediately destroys the entire snowman.
