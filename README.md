# Snowball Fight
Snowball Fight is a single player VR where the player throws snowballs. The player can practice with targets or challenge the snowman horde in a never-ending survival game mode.

It was developed by [Alex Kastanek](https://github.com/AlexKastanek) and [Bryce Monaco](https://github.com/BryceDMonaco) as the final project for CS 491 (Topics: Virtual Reality) in spring 2018.

In the survival gamemode, snowmen get close to the player and start damaging them. Hitting a snowman with a snowball makes that section of their body explode into purple smoke.

In the survival gamemode, a snowball is just about to hit a snowman in the head. Hitting a snowman in the head immediately destroys the entire snowman.
